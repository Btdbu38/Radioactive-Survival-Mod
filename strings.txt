description: This menu is about your characters health and condition. \n As you can see, there are four separate areas that have HP. Head, Torso, Arms and Legs. You must protect them as you can. \n Getting any damage to any body area have a chance, you have a chance to dodge it too, and the more mobile you are, the more dodge chance you have. \n Having out of HP on head and torso is instant death. If your legs are dead, you move very hardly and it increases pain. If your arms are dead you can not use guns accurately and performing any action will increase pain. \n And you can heal them with medical kits. \n By the way, you can get some wound types such as scratches, lacerations and lodged bullet. The more mobile you are, the lower chances to get deadlier wounds. \n For healing these wounds, find any kind of medical items.

Bacakların canı biterse yavaş koşarsınız ve koşmak ağrıya sebep olur.

description: -Strelok: So you woke up? \n -Me: Eh, my head is aching a little, nothing much. \n -Strelok: That's great. Anyways, outside is definite non-safe, remember that. Welcome to the Zone. If you wonder about the globe, let me shorten it. People had fought each other, each country, each city. Used their biggest and dangerous weapons, nuclear rockets. Which killed both attackers and defenders side. But this was a huge purge for the humanity, it is more like taking a shower. Anyways. Currently, we're at a little, not so little town called Zanov. An abandoned city located in Ukraine, nearby to the Chernobly NPP. This place was a radioactive wasteland even before the events of nuclear wars. We had enough experience to survive a radioactive catasphore. And we did. Although the Zone had spreaded the whole world since the nuclear wars has begun, places not like the Pripyat is safer. And secondly, we have a huge threat. Bandits and Marauders. It doesn't sounds like we will stay here. \n -Me: So people in here need something that can move us? \n -Strelok: Exactly, but think twice. Anomalies are being spreaded around the Zone, a car can be crushed easily. \n -Me: What is an anomaly? \n Strelok: You will see it, and will get it when you see it. Go clear your head a bit.

We will want you to scout the nearby areas, find some gears in order to maintain cars and much more. Hunt, trade with the local people here and get yourself better gear. You can always find some people that needs a help. Nimble will hand over some gear to you. \n -Me: Thanks Strelok. \n -Strelok: Also, be careful about the hostile stalkers and survivors, you may get your ass dead if they catch you with no gear. Detect them before they do. Usually Bandits are patrolling nearby the city, be careful. I am no longer so young. Can not fight enough as I do in the past.
